node-socket.io-client
=====================

#### Sockets for the rest of us (server-side)

This is a node.js implementation of the Socket.IO client (https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO). The syntax is exactly the same:

	socket = new io.Socket('localhost');
	socket.connect();
	socket.on('connect', function(){
		// connected
	});
	socket.on('message', function(data){
		// data here
	});
	socket.send('some data');

### Features

- Supports 
	- WebSocket
	- Adobe Flash Socket (Which is the same as a Websocket)
	- ActiveX HTMLFile (IE)
	- XHR with long-polling
	- JSONP polling (for cross-domain)

### How to use
	
Just require the client via:

	var io = require("./path/to/node-socket.io-client/socket.io").io;

Afterwards you can use the io object the same way you would do with the browser client:

	socket = new io.Socket('localhost');
	socket.connect();
	socket.send('some data');
	socket.on('message', function(data){
		alert('got some data' + data);
	});

### Notes

After cloning make sure to initialize and update the submodules, otherwise node-socket.io-client will fail:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

### Documentation 

#### io.Socket

	new io.Socket(host, [options]);

Options:

- *port*

		Current port or 80
	
	The port `socket.io` server is attached to (defaults to the document.location port)

- *resource*

		socket.io

  The resource is what allows the `socket.io` server to identify incoming connections by `socket.io` clients. In other words, any HTTP server can implement socket.io and still serve other normal, non-realtime HTTP requests.

- *transport*

	A specific transport. Supported transports are `websocket`, `flashsocket`, `htmlfile`, `xhr-polling` and `jsonp-polling`. Defaults to `websocket`.
	
- *transportOptions*
	
		{
			someTransport: {
				someOption: true
			},
			...
		}
				
	An object containing (optional) options to pass to each transport.

Properties:

- *options*

	The passed in options combined with the defaults

- *connected*

	Whether the socket is connected or not.
	
- *connecting*

	Whether the socket is connecting or not.
	
- *transport*	

	The transport instance.

Methods:
	
- *connect*

	Establishes a connection	
	
- *send(message)*
	
	A string of data to send.
	
- *disconnect*

	Closes the connection
	
- *on(event, λ)*

	Adds a listener for the event *event*
	
- *removeEvent(event, λ)*

	Removes the listener λ for the event *event*
	
Events:

- *connect*

	Fired when the connection is established and the handshake successful
	
- *connecting(transport_type)*

  Fired when a connection is attempted, passing the transport name
	
- *connect_failed*

  Fired when the connection timeout occurs after the last connection attempt.
	This only fires if the `connectTimeout` option is set.
	If the `tryTransportsOnConnectTimeout` option is set, this only fires once all
	possible transports have been tried.
	
- *message(message)*
	
	Fired when a message arrives from the server

- *close*

	Fired when the connection is closed. Be careful with using this event, as some transports will fire it even under temporary, expected disconnections (such as XHR-Polling).
	
- *disconnect*

	Fired when the connection is considered disconnected.
